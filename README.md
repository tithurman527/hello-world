# hello-world

Hello!

I am Terence Thurman, a senior computer engineering student from Charleston, SC.  I enjoy playing football and basketball,
along with video games.  I am currently building my own website and perfecting my skills as a software developer.

I hope to study abroad in the fall at the American University of Sharjah.
